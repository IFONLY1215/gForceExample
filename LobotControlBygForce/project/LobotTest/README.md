seven gestures such as fist,spread,wave in,wave out,pinch,shoot,and reset pose.
The mechanical arm will make a gesture what the gForce recognize.

```Note: This is project is based on Arudino Mega and lobot control board.We send control command to lobot control board by Mega's uart```
```Lobat control board perform action what received from Arduino Mega```
```The mechanial arm is named Lobot```
